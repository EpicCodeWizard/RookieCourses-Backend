###### ***We are all middle schoolers (8th grade), so we would like to go for the Middle School prize category.***
# ☁️ Inspiration
Learning is important because it helps people feel happier, feel more fulfilled in their lives and careers, and maintain strong cognitive functioning. Everyone needs to learn, whatever age they are, and all of us learn everyday. Whether you go to school, or work, or anything in between, you enter an environment where you gain information. Our application, `RookieCourses`, recreates this environment online.

# 🚧 What It Does
`RookieCourses` is a place where rookies can become pros by watching lessons by the pros. this project is a learning website where people can post lessons and view lessons, essentially a knowledge sharing place.

# 👨🏾‍💻 How We Built It
For the frontend, we used `Angular.js`. This was our first time using it, and we are not joking when we say this was the hardest thing we've ever done. All of us were familiar using `React.js`, as we've always used it before, but switching to `Angular.js` was extremely hard. We spent hours debugging simple errors and we were programming much slower. For the backend, we had similar problems when using `Firestore`. We always utilize something such as `MongoDB`, but this time, we wanted to challenge ourselves, going with the theme, so we decided to use `Firestore`. Though not as long as the frontend, we spent many hours debugging `Firestore` and the graphical database. Finally, the easiest part of all this was `Twilio`, which we integrated quickly as our chatbot.

# 👷 Challenges We Ran Into
We ran into an unbelievable number of challenges (I'm even surprised we finished the application)! Using `Angular.js` and `Firestore` was extremely hard, and we did it to match the theme. We really wanted to match the theme and go with the most opposite frameworks to our preferences to learn something new. For a more detailed explanation, refer to `👨🏾‍💻 How We Built It` (⬆️).

# 🎉 Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We actually finished the app...yay! On a serious note, we are incredibly proud to have learned and achieved so much. At the beginning of the hackathon, we never knew `Angular.js` or `Firestore`. Now, we know both frameworks very well, and might even use them in a future hackathon. We are also proud that we were able to work together so well even when both the frontend and backend were having issues.

# 📙 What We Learned
We learned a lot, specifically `Angular.js` and `Firestore`. For a more detailed explanation, refer to `👨🏾‍💻 How We Built It` (⬆️).

# 🔜 What's Next For RookieCourses
- Better Styling
- Other Options For Courses
- Better Course Posting Feature

# 🥇 Firsts
- First Time Using `Angular.js`
- First Time Using `Firestore`
- First Time Communicating With Someone From EST,PST And IST

# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Best Social Impact
We believe our project has the best social impact because it helps people learn. After COVID, many people are trying to rebuild a good lifestyle, and part of that is learning new skills. Our website, a place where rookies and pros connect, is perfect for them. Our website can help anyone and everyone learn a new skill!

# 🎯 Most Practical
Our app is the most practical as it helps people learn in an online environment. Anyone can use it and become smarter by connecting with people. Also, people can post courses and easily spread information. If you have a hidden talent, such as pen spinning, and would like to share it, our website is the place to do so.
